Marketing Tips

I know many cafe and restaurant owners who prefer boosting posts because it’s simple and easy to navigate..

While that’s true, there’s a lot of potential wasted when you boost posts instead of running ads through Facebook Ads Manager. 🤯

Boosted posts on Facebook are just regular posts that you pay to show to a wider audience.

Yes, your post will reach more people or get more engagement. 👀

But there’s a chance it might be seen by an audience that isn’t interested in your offer.

If you want to ensure your money is well spent, consider running ads through Facebook Ads Manager. 🍂
